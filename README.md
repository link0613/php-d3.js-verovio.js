# User Login & Management System

### Description
1) the verovioviewer has the possibility to zoom in and out. I want to attach an item to a notehead. When zooming in and out, the item that I dragged and dropped sticks to the note.
2) it has to be stored, so by page refresh it sticks to it's place. It also needs an 'x', for the case you want to remove it.
3) if I do this in my musicschool on a tablet, I want to send it to the tablet of my student, so when he/she opens the link, he/she will see the same.  
4) User Login & Management System is a PHP + MySQLi powered PHP script built up under the CodeIgniter framework(version 3.x),
